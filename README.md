# LINE-UP APP :hourglass_flowing_sand:

LINE-UP is a web application that allows its users to book appointments online at different locations. It provides convenience and flexibility, allowing users to quickly and easily reserve and manage their appointments. It also enables operators at these locations to efficiently and effectively manage the flow of appointments.

User/Client: Users can view the availability of appointments at a particular location, reserve an appointment, cancel it, and modify it if necessary. Additionally, they will receive reminders to keep them informed about their scheduled appointments.

Location Operators: Operators can view and manage the list of appointments at their location, as well as modify the status of appointments that have been made.

Admin User: Admin users can create, edit, and delete new locations, determine hours of operation for each location, have access to all appointments made at all locations, and have privileges to create new operators/branches.
